üöÄ Project Description

The House Price Prediction project leverages machine learning to predict house prices based on various features such as size, location, and other relevant attributes. This project demonstrates:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing raw data for modeling.
Model training: Implementing and optimizing a machine learning algorithm for price prediction.
Evaluation: Assessing the model‚Äôs performance and accuracy using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Deployment: Making predictions accessible through a user-friendly interface.
This project is ideal for understanding the workflow of a data science and machine learning pipeline.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools and dependencies are installed:

Python (>= 3.7)
Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Steps to Set Up
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/NdanyuzweP/house_prediction.git
cd house_prediction
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Prepare the dataset:
Replace data/house_data.csv with your dataset if applicable.
Ensure the dataset contains relevant features for house price prediction.
Run the application or model training script:
python app.py  # Replace with the main script for your project
View results or predictions:
The outputs will be saved in the /results directory or displayed in the terminal/console.
