## 🚀 Project Description  

The **House Price Prediction** project leverages machine learning to predict house prices based on various features such as size, location, and other relevant attributes. This project demonstrates:  

- **Data preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw data for modeling.  
- **Model training**: Implementing and optimizing a machine learning algorithm for price prediction.  
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model’s performance and accuracy using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).  
- **Deployment**: Making predictions accessible through a user-friendly interface.  

This project is ideal for understanding the workflow of a data science and machine learning pipeline.
